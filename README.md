# Comparative-Analysis-of-GPT-vs-BERT-Models-Codebase
Comparative codebase analyzing ChatGPT vs BERT performance on NLP tasks, benchmarks, and use cases.


📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation, experiments, and analysis for the research project “Comparative Analysis of ChatGPT vs BERT Models.”
The goal is to systematically evaluate and contrast the performance, architecture, and practical applications of ChatGPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) across diverse NLP tasks.

By providing a reproducible codebase and structured evaluation pipeline, this project aims to serve as a resource for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in large language models (LLMs), transformer-based architectures, and their comparative strengths.

🎯 Objectives

- Conduct a comparative performance evaluation of ChatGPT and BERT on benchmark NLP tasks.

- Analyze architectural differences between autoregressive (GPT) and bidirectional (BERT) transformer models.

- Highlight use cases, limitations, and trade-offs in adopting either model.

- Provide a reproducible experimental framework for future studies.

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Models will be compared using:

- Classification Tasks: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Language Generation: BLEU, ROUGE, Perplexity
- Efficiency: Inference time, parameter size, resource usage
- Robustness: Generalization across unseen tasks

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/Comparative-Analysis-ChatGPT-vs-BERT.git
- cd Comparative-Analysis-ChatGPT-vs-BERT

2. Install Dependencies
- pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run Experiments

Example (BERT fine-tuning on sentiment analysis):

- python src/bert/train.py --task sentiment

Example (ChatGPT evaluation on summarization):

📑 Research Methodology

Dataset Selection: Use standard NLP benchmark datasets (GLUE, SQuAD, IMDB, CNN/DailyMail, etc.).

Model Preparation:

  - Fine-tune BERT using Hugging Face Transformers.

  - Query ChatGPT via OpenAI API or equivalent setup.

Task Coverage: Classification, Question Answering, Summarization, Text Generation.

Comparative Analysis: Document findings with quantitative metrics and qualitative insights.
